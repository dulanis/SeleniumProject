# SeleniumProject

This selenium project employs a page object design pattern in conjunction with a web driver singleton design pattern to automate end-user behavior, black-box testing of expedia.com.

The following packages are tasked with the following contributions:
––pageObjects: contains the various page objects of the website we're testing
––playground: not essential contribution to the execution of tests; simply a sandbox of sorts where I experimented with snippets of code before employing them in my tests
––runner: contains the cucumber runner class
––stepDefs: contains the step definitions for the feature files specified in src/test/resources/features
